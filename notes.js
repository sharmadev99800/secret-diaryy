      These were the days when everything felt light.
      Conversations without clocks.
      Laughs that didn’t need reasons.
      Silence that still felt warm.

      Some people don’t leave suddenly.
      They slowly become memories.

      Not because I couldn’t,
      but because some feelings deserve quiet.

      If you’re reading this,
      you already know what I mean.

      Not everything needs closure.
      Some chapters end without explanations.
      And that’s okay.

      Growth sometimes means letting go
      without noise.
